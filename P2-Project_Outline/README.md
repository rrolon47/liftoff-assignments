## Submission Instructions

### Overview

ToDyeFor is a web application that allows surface designers and textile artist to calculate, search, create and keep track of dye recipies.  The idea came from working  for 5 years in a small surface design studio where all the recipes and fabric swatches were recorded and calculated by hand and stored in binders and bins. Needless to say it could be unorganized at times and lead to lost recipies, incorrect calculations and wondering where this bautiful scrap of fabric came from and how to replicate it.  ToDyeFor aims to remove the headache of keeping track of dye recipies, incorrect calculations, and searching for a desired recipe. 


### Features
 
 * **User Accounts**: Users will be able to create an account and login to create, read, update and delete recipes. 
 * **Image upload**:  Account holders will have the option to upload a photo of a fabric swatch for a finished dye recipe.
 * **Public Dye Calculator**: Users will be able to input dye type and fabric ammount to calculate needed weights for chemicals and dye in a recipe. 
 * **Search Recipies by Color, Fabric, and Dye**: Users will be able to search for dye recipes made by account holders accourding to tags of color, fabric, and dye.
 
### Technologies

* JavaScript
* C#
* ASP.NET
* MongoDB or MySQL


### What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn how to have a user upload an image and have it stored in a database that can be searched.  I think to do this we will have to use MongoDB so I will need to learn how to work with a new database.  To create the Dye Calculator I will need to brush up on my JavaScript skills to make it interactive. I will also need to learn how to incorperate JS into the front end and have C# work with MongoDB for the back end.
